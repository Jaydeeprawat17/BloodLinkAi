# ü©∏ BloodLink AI

A smart donor prediction and engagement platform designed to support Thalassemia patients by ensuring timely access to blood through intelligent matching, predictive availability, and donor retention tools.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

Thalassemia patients require frequent blood transfusions, but the unpredictability of donor availability and lack of recurring engagement often leads to life-threatening delays.

**BloodLink AI** solves this by:
- Predicting blood donor availability based on past donation patterns.
- Matching patients with optimal nearby eligible donors.
- Sending personalized reminders to donors via WhatsApp/SMS.
- Using gamification to encourage consistent blood donation.
- Supporting multilingual Q&A for patients and donors using AI chat.
